The film follows various characters and scenes, never staying with one character or conversation for more than a few minutes before picking up someone else in the scene and following them. The characters include Linklater as a talkative taxi passenger, a UFO buff who insists the U.S. has been on the moon since the 1950s, a JFK conspiracy theorist, an elderly anarchist who befriends a man trying to rob his house, a serial television set collector and a woman trying to sell a Madonna pap smear. The woman selling the pap smear appears on the movie poster, and was played by Butthole Surfers drummer Teresa Taylor.<ref name Raftery | first  | title  Salon.com | pages  | date  http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2006/07/05/slacker/index.html | accessdate = 2009-09-09 }} Most of the characters grapple with feelings of social exclusion or political marginalization, which are recurring themes in their conversations.

"Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr.  and his wife Dora  settle down in a peaceful little town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the ""fastest gun alive"". George becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk. One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold  has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the ""fastest gun in the west"", and he listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called ""fast guns"". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a ""ribbon clerk"". HIs pride stung, he goes back to his store, retrieves his gun from hiding , belts it on, and - over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built - says ""they have to know who I am"" and goes to the bar. The men are astonished - and a little afraid - at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... ""...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him."" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the ""fast gun"" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out ""the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time"", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now ""forget"" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as ""the fastest gun alive,"" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.","['fastest_gun_in_the_west', 'fastest_gun_in_the_west', 'fastest_gun_in_the_west', 'fastest_gun_in_the_west', 'fastest_gun_in_the_west', 'fastest_gun_in_the_west', 'fastest_gun_in_the_west']"

"The eponymous character, played by Jimmy Wang, has hung up his signature broken sword and is living peacefully with his wife. However, a band of tyrannical sword masters take over the country, using their own signature styles and unique weapons to conquer all the sword fighting schools. They capture all the masters and teachers of the schools and deliver an ultimatum: all the students must cut off their sword arms and surrender the severed limbs to the evil warlords, or the students' beloved teachers will all die. The students turn to the legendary One-Armed Swordsman, who is at first reluctant but is convinced when a student actually does sacrificially chop his own arm off when he refuses to help.

" A Dirty Carnival is the story of Kim Byung-doo , a small-time gangster in his late 20s. Unable to acquire the money necessary to save his family from eviction, Byung-Doo subverts his boss, Sang-chul , and takes a job directly from President Hwang , Sang-chul's boss, to eliminate the public attorney Park who has been bothersome to President Hwang. On this job's completion, Byung-Doo receives the money he was hoping for in addition to President Hwang's respect and a spot at his side. Byung-Doo and President Hwang swear never to speak of the hit to anyone so that they, nor the organization, will not be implicated. While these events are happening, Byung-doo is reunited with his high school friend, Min-ho , who has become a movie director. Min-ho's cuurrent project is a gangster film, although prospective scripts are continuously shot down by his higher-ups for being too fake. In an attempt to improve the film's authenticity, Min-ho sets out to interview Byung-doo who he sees as ""a real gangster"". Meanwhile, Min-ho manages to reunite Byung-doo with his high school love interest, Hyun-joo . Byung-doo finds that he still has an interest in her and attempts to rekindle their relationship. Sang-chul becomes aware of the attorney Park murder and feels threatened by Byung-doo's subversion of his authority and lack of consideration for the organization. He sets up a hit to take out Byung-doo, but Byung-doo learns of this before it occurs and manages to murder Sang-chul first, guaranteeing his safety in the short term. These murders don't leave Byung-doo without heavy emotional baggage, however. When Byung-doo's gangster tendencies frighten Hyun-joo away, Min-ho attempts to console Byung-doo who reveals to Min-ho his darkest secrets, including the hits on both Attorney Park and his former boss, Sang-chul. Missing Hyun-joo deeply, Byung-doo tries to hide his gangster tendencies to revive their relationship. However, despite his words to Hyun-joo otherwise, Byung-doo is unable to truly escape the gangster occupation. In fact, as his rank within the gang escalates, his actions become more violent and cruel, juxtaposing his ever growing affection for Hyun-joo. Soon Byung-doo discovers that Min-ho's gangster film reenacts many of the events from Byung-doo's past, including the hit on Attorney Park. Realizing the dangers of the organization being implicated, Byung-doo confronts Min-ho and threatens him never to tell anyone, choosing to spare his life despite pleas from his underlings that he do otherwise. These underlings later decide to take matters into their own hands and threaten Min-ho more seriously than Byung-doo was willing to do, but still sparing his life. It is then that Min-ho, deeply disturbed, goes to the police and informs them of the potential threats on his life. The police attempt to arrest Byung-doo but fail. It is then that Byung-doo believes that the proper solution is to eliminate Min-ho once and for all. As Min-ho  have become quite popular, it will not be an easy job - Byung-doo intends to perform the hit and fly out of the country, escaping the consequences of his actions. Byung-doo moves to assassinate Min-ho at an after-party for his film. Min-ho manages to escape outside where he is captured by Byung-doo's underlings who are supposed to take Min-ho to a planned location for Byung-doo to meet them at. Upon arrival, Byung-doo is attacked by unknown thugs. Despite being outnumbered, Byung-doo manages to stumble away from his attackers, heavily wounded. He appears to be saved as his underlings arrive on the scene, however, they betray Byung-doo and kill him. Notably, Jong-soo , Byung-doo's former right-hand man and his lone accomplice in the President Hwang murder, is present and appears to be leading the betrayal. The scene shifts to a meeting with President Hwang and Min-ho, who appears to be alive and well despite being captured by Byung-doo's men. President Hwang discusses potential movie ideas with Min-ho, saying he can draw inspiration from the stories of his past, though they shouldn't be too close to the truth for as he says, ""a fiction should remain a fiction"", referencing Min-ho's first movie and its connection to Byung-doo's untimely fate. Soon Jong-soo joins the meeting, taking Byung-doo's position at President Hwang's side, showcasing his subversion much in the same way that Byung-doo subverted his own boss, Sang-chul. The final scene is a repetition from earlier in the film, where Byung-doo visits Min-ho on his movie set to give him advice. Byung-doo encourages Min-ho with the friendly words, ""Make something with a real gangster spirit,"" reinforcing the strength of the friendship and gangster themes running througout the film.","['dirty_cop', 'dirty_cop', 'dirty_cop', 'dirty_cop', 'dirty_cop', 'dirty_cop', 'dirty_cop']"

"Due to a shortage of Police Officers, the newly-elected female Mayor of an unnamed American city has announced a policy requiring the Police Department to accept all willing recruits, effectively abolishing fitness requirements, educational levels and medical standards. Not everyone in the Police Force is happy about the new changes. Carey Mahoney  is an easygoing man who has repeatedly gotten himself in trouble with the law when standing up to arrogance. Mahoney is forced to join the Police Force as an alternative to jail, a proposal by Captain Reed who has been lenient on Mahoney because of knowing his father, who was also a Policeman. Mahoney reluctantly agrees to this, deciding that he will get himself thrown out as a loophole. However, the Chief of Police , outraged by the Mayor's lowered requirements, decides that the new cadets should be forced to quit rather than being thrown out. Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris , who trains the cadets, agrees with the plan and employs tactics to make their lives as miserable as possible so that they do in fact quit. However, Commandant Lassard  is the only one who doesn't agree with both Harris and the Chief of Police's schemes. He wants to give the new cadets a chance. Mahoney tries many schemes to get thrown out as he cannot quit, since as part of the deal he made with Captain Reed, if he quits, he will be sent to jail. But eventually has a change of heart and decides to stay for good, having fallen in love with another cadet, Karen Thompson . While in the Academy, Mahoney becomes friends with fellow cadets Larvell Jones , a human beatbox; George Martin , a ladies man who speaks with a fake Spanish accent to attract women; Eugene Tackleberry , a military obsessed adrenaline junkie; Leslie Barbara , an overweight wimp; and Moses Hightower , a giant of a man who is actually quite shy and keeps away from violence. Mahoney helps Hightower prepare for the critical driving test and after he passes; Hightower is very thankful to Mahoney. Unfortunately, the ""quit policy"" does not apply to Hightower, who gets himself kicked out of the Academy by Harris because of an incident. After the hated cadet Chad Copeland ([[Scott Thomson  racially insults his friend and fellow cadet Laverne Hooks , Hightower is offended and lifts the Police car in which Copeland is seated. Despite Hooks and Harris trying to reason with him to calm down, he turns the car over on Copeland. Later on, both he and Kyle Blankes  discovered what happened to their car. Shortly after this, Mahoney and Barbara are having lunch in the cafeteria and talking about Hightower's expulsion. He's finally getting sick of being in the Academy, but refuses to quit. Despite Blankes and Copeland's attempt to get him to fight them so they can give Harris a reason to expel him, he still refuses. Barbara throws the first punch by hitting Copeland with a lunch tray and he passes out from it. Blankes is offended by him and punches him back, which promptly gets Mahoney involved in a brawl with him. When Lt. Harris asks them who started it, Mahoney takes the blame for throwing the first punch to protect Barbara's standing, which finally gives him the green light to expel his most despised cadet. Before Mahoney actually leaves the premises, however, a major riot breaks out downtown. The resulting Police emergency forces the cadets into real action for the first time. During the riot, a wanted criminal manages to steal two Police revolvers from Blankes and Copeland.

"The film opens with a carnival in Venice as a prelude to a series of erotic encounters that follow Giacomo Casanova through the cities of 18th century Europe. It is during this festival that a gigantic bust fails to rise from the water, which is taken as a bad omen. Casanova is then introduced as he defiles a fake nun for the pleasure of a rich voyeur; Casanova succeeds in entertaining him, but he is frustrated that the man finds no interest in his alchemical research and further scheming. As he rows back to mainland, Casanova is arrested, judged and imprisoned by the High Court over his famed debauchery. During his time in prison, Casanova reminisces of his affair with a seamstress and later on one of her servants, Anna Maria, who is bound by frequent fainting and requires constant bloodletting. He eventually consummates his desire to be with Anna Maria. Back in prison, Casanova escapes through the rooftops and exiles himself from Venice, being taken into the Paris court of the Madame d'Urfé. The Madame, an aged woman, enthralled by Casanova's apparent knowledge of alchemy, wishes to transform her soul into a man's through ritualistic intercourse with him . Casanova then moves to the court of a hunchback, Du Bois, in between taking charge of a beautiful girl—""the love of [his] life""—Henriette. Du Bois puts on a homosexual performance for his guests that unsettles some of his guests and Casanova is brought to tears as Henriette plays some music. The lovers vow fidelity to each other, but the following morning Henriette has disappeared. Du Bois informs Casanova that an emissary of a far-away court has reclaimed Henriette, and she's left her bidding that Casanova not attempt following her. While in London, an aged Casanova is robbed by two women and he attempts suicide by drowning himself in the Thames. A vision of a giantess and two dwarves detracts him, and follows them to a Frost fair, where he arm-wrestles the giantess—a princess—and later pays to watch her bathe with the dwarves. Casanova resumes his travelling the following day. He frequents a deranged party at Lord Talou's in Rome, where he wins a bet with a stagecoach driver, Righetto, over how many orgasms he can have in one hour. The competition brings him higher acclaim. In Germany he falls in love with an alchemist's daughter, Isabella, who fails to keep up with an appointment to go to Dresden with him; Casanova instead partakes in an orgy within the hostel he's been stranded. He has a brief, chance encounter with his enstranged mother in a theater. He then moves to a court in Württemberg, where his desire to be taken seriously as a writer/inventor are frustrated by the court's orgiastic, wild nature. It is here that he meets Rosalba, a mechanical doll with whom he shares a dance and later on goes to bed with. Times goes by and an old Casanova finds himself librarian to Count Waldstein at his castle in Dux. Life at the castle is more than frustrating for Casanova, as he is made eat with other servants and does not get the respect nor the food he claims to deserve. Waldstein's manservant, Faulkircher, and his lover Vidarol, make him object of mockery and animosity. A portrait of him is hanged and defecated on. Later on, during a fervent poetry recital, a court member fails to suppress a giggle at Casanova, who, humiliated and disappointed, goes back up to his room. The final scene has a weary, bloodshot Casanova cringing in an armchair and recounting a recent dream. In this dream, Casanova is back in Venice. He catches a glimpse of the giant bust seen in the beginning of the film, buried under thick layers of ice in the river. He chases the ghosts of his past lovers, all of whom disappear. An ornate stagecoach beckons him to join its passengers. He finally meets with Rosalba, the mechanical doll, once again. They quietly dance with each other.","['casanova', 'casanova', 'casanova', 'casanova', 'casanova', 'casanova', 'casanova']"
