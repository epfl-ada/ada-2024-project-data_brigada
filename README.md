## Methods

### Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing normalizes movie information and character information so that trends in heroic and villainous portrayal, together with actor roles, can be analyzed over time. Revenue figures were adjusted for inflation to put them on a comparable footing to enable meaningful comparisons of commercial success across years. Other fields, like languages, countries, and genres, were brought into formats easily manipulable. Ethnicity data was mostly missing or in an unusable form using Freebase ID format and thus was supplemented to allow demographic analysis.
